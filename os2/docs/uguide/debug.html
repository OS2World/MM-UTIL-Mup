Debugging
</H2>
<P>

Since Mup requires its input in a fairly strict format, when a song is put
in, it may contain &quot;typos.&quot; Generally, the error messages that Mup prints

will give you an idea of what is wrong. However, sometimes Mup is not able
to recognize that something is wrong until some distance beyond the actual
error. If you can't find anything wrong with the line that Mup lists as
being in error, try looking at the end of the previous line, or even earlier
lines. Some of the most common problems are missing semicolons and missing

quotes. Missing quote marks tend to be especially confusing to Mup, and may
cause many error messages, even though there is only one problem.
Another common problem that may cause a very large number of error messages is
forgetting to state &quot;music&quot; to enter music context.

Often listening to

is much more effective at spotting things like wrong notes and missing
accidentals than trying to find them by eye.
