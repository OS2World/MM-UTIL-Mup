Mup Options
</H2>
<P>
Mup accepts a number

of options.
When invoking Mup from a command line,
the options are specified by a dash followed by a letter.
On Windows/MS-DOS

systems, you can substitute a slash instead of the dash.
If you are using Mupmate, you will use the &quot;Set Options&quot; form off
of the &quot;Run&quot; menu to set the options.
You just fill values into the form, and Mupmate will 
take care of the details of running Mup with your values,
so you won't use the dash and letter shown below at all.
Some of the options listed below are not available from Mupmate,
either because they are meant for debugging, and thus not generally
of interest to most users, or because Mupmate handles the appropriate
details automatically.

The options to the mup command (in alphabetical order) are:
<HR>
<CODE>Command line:&nbsp;</CODE>
<A NAME="coption"><B>-c</B> <I>N</I></A>
<BR>
<CODE>Mupmate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</CODE>
Run &gt; Set Options &gt; Enable Auto Multirest and Min Measures to Combine
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>

Combine consecutive measures of all rests or spaces into



<A HREF="multirst.html">multirests</A>

(multiple measures of rest printed as a single measure,
usually with the number of
<A HREF="param.html#prmultn">measures of rest printed</A>
above the staff).
Any time there
are <I>N</I> or more measures in a row that consist entirely of rests or spaces,
they will be replaced by a multirest. The combining of measures 
stops when there is a visible staff that contains notes


or lyrics, or that contain
<A HREF="textmark.html">text</A>
or
<A HREF="mussym.html">musical symbols</A>
after the first beat of the measure,
or when there are
<A HREF="param.html">parameter changes</A>
on a visible staff or in score context that



<A HREF="param.html#visible">change</A>
<A HREF="param.html#clef">clef,</A>

<A HREF="param.html#key">key,</A>

or
<A HREF="param.html#time">time signature,</A>

or when there is a
<A HREF="bars.html">bar line</A>

other than an ordinary bar.
This option is most likely to be useful when printing a subset of staffs,
where the particular staff(s) you are printing have long periods of rests.
See information about
<A HREF="cmdargs.html#soption">the -s option</A>
and the
<A HREF="param.html#visible">"visible" parameter</A>
below.

This option overrides the
<A HREF="param.html#restcomb">restcombine parameter.</A>
<HR>
<CODE>Command line:&nbsp;</CODE>
<B>-C</B>
<BR>
<CODE>Mupmate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</CODE>
Option not available (only used for debugging).
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>

This option is only used in connection with
<A HREF="cmdargs.html#Eoption">the -E option.</A>
It specifies that comments

are to be passed through rather than deleted.
<HR>
<CODE>Command line:&nbsp;</CODE>
<A NAME="dbgoption"><B>-d</B> <I>N</I></A>
<BR>
<CODE>Mupmate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</CODE>
Option not available (only used for debugging).
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>

Print debugging information. <I>N</I> is a bitmap, so you can turn on multiple

debugging levels by adding up the flag values. For example, if you want to
turn on both level 2 and level 4 tracing, <I>N</I> would be 6 (because 2+4=6).

</DL>
<I>N</I> can be specified in decimal, octal
(by using a leading zero), or hex (by using a leading 0x).
This information is intended for debugging of
Mup itself and thus is not likely to be of use to the average user,
and is not available from Mupmate.
<HR>
<CODE>Command line:&nbsp;</CODE>
<A NAME="doption"><B>-D</B> <I>MACRO[=macro-def]</I></A>
<BR>
<CODE>Mupmate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</CODE>
Run &gt; Set Options &gt; Macro Definitions
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>

Define
the
<A HREF="macros.html">macro</A>

<I>MACRO</I>. The macro name must consist of
upper case letters, digits, and underscores, beginning

with an upper case letter. The <I>macro_def</I> is optional, and gives the
text of the macro. On UNIX, Linux, or similar

systems, if it contains any white space
or other special characters, it must be quoted. On other systems, white
space may not be allowed.
The -D option can be specified multiple times, if you wish to
define more than one macro.
<HR>
<CODE>Command line:&nbsp;</CODE>
<B>-e</B> <I>errfile</I>
<BR>
<CODE>Mupmate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</CODE>
Option not needed. Mupmate automatically saves and displays error output.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>

Place the error message output into <I>errfile</I> instead of writing it to
the standard error output stream.
<HR>
<CODE>Command line:&nbsp;</CODE>
<A NAME="Eoption"><B>-E</B></A>
<BR>
<CODE>Mupmate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</CODE>
Option not needed (only used for debugging).
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>

Rather than produce PostScript or MIDI output, just expand

macros

and includes,
and write the result to the standard output stream.
Comments in the input are deleted, unless the -C option is also specified.
<HR>
<CODE>Command line:&nbsp;</CODE>
<B>-f</B> <I>outfile</I>
<BR>
<CODE>Mupmate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</CODE>
Option not needed. Mupmate automatically creates appropriate output file.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>

Place the PostScript output into <I>outfile</I> instead of writing to
the standard output.
<HR>
<CODE>Command line:&nbsp;</CODE>
<A NAME="Foption"><B>-F</B></A>
<BR>
<CODE>Mupmate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</CODE>
Run &gt; Write PostScript File
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>

This is like the <B>-f</B> option, except the name of the output file is
derived from the name of the Mup input file. If the name of the Mup input
file ends with a &quot;.mup&quot; suffix, the generated PostScript output
file will end with a &quot;.ps&quot; suffix instead.
If the name of the Mup input file ends with
a &quot;.MUP&quot; suffix, the PostScript file will end with a &quot;.PS&quot; suffix.
Otherwise, a &quot;.ps&quot; suffix will be appended to the end of the Mup
input file name. If multiple input files are listed, the last is used.
If none are specified (input is read from standard input),
the name &quot;stdin.ps&quot; will be used for the output file.
<HR>
<CODE>Command line:&nbsp;</CODE>
<A NAME="moption"><B>-m</B> <I>midifile</I></A>
<BR>
<CODE>Mupmate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</CODE>
Option not needed. Mupmate automatically creates appropriate output file.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>

Instead of generating PostScript output,
generate standard
<A HREF="midi.html">MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) output,</A>

and put it in <I>midifile</I>.
This option also causes the
<A HREF="macros.html">macro</A>
&quot;MIDI&quot; to become defined.
<HR>
<CODE>Command line:&nbsp;</CODE>
<B>-M</B>
<BR>
<CODE>Mupmate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</CODE>
Run &gt; Write MIDI File
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>

This is like the <B>-m</B> option, except the name of the MIDI file is
derived from the name of the Mup input file. If the name of the Mup input
file ends with a &quot;.mup&quot; suffix, the generated MIDI file will end with
a &quot;.mid&quot; suffix instead. If the name of the Mup input file ends with
a &quot;.MUP&quot; suffix, the MIDI file will end with a &quot;.MID&quot; suffix.
Otherwise, a &quot;.mid&quot; suffix will be appended to the end of the Mup
input file name. If multiple input files are listed, the last is used.
If none are specified (input is read from standard input),
the name &quot;stdin.mid&quot; will be used for the MIDI file.
<HR>
<CODE>Command line:&nbsp;</CODE>
<A NAME="ooption"><B>-o</B> <I>pagelist</I></A>
<BR>
<CODE>Mupmate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</CODE>
Run &gt; Set Options &gt; Pages to Display
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>

Print only the pages
given in <I>pagelist</I>. The <I>pagelist</I> can be
a comma-separated list of numbers or ranges, where a range is two numbers
separated by a dash. For example, -o1,7-9,12-14 would print pages 1, 7, 8,
9, 12, 13, and 14. Alternately, the <I>pagelist</I> can be the special
keyword &quot;odd&quot; or &quot;even&quot; which will cause all odd or even numbered pages

to be printed. This may be useful if you have a printer that only makes
single-sided copies, but you wish to print Mup output double-sided. You could
print odd-numbered pages, then turn the paper over and feed the pages
through again for the even-numbered pages. 
Pages will be printed in the order specified, so you can print pages in
other than ascending order if you wish, or even print the same page
more than once. Printing pages in non-ascending order is most likely to
be useful when printing more than one page of music on a single physical
page, using the
<A HREF="param.html#panels">panelsperpage parameter.</A>
<HR>
<CODE>Command line:&nbsp;</CODE>
<A NAME="poption"><B>-p</B> <I>N</I></A>
<BR>
<CODE>Mupmate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</CODE>
Run &gt; Set Options &gt; First Page's Page Number
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>

Start numbering pages
at <I>N</I> instead of at 1.
This can be set inside the Mup input file
with
<A HREF="param.html#firstpg">the "firstpage" parameter,</A>
but the command line option will override the parameter.

If <B>-o</B> and <B>-p</B> are used together, the page numbers given in the
<B>-o</B><I>pagelist</I> must be the printed page numbers. For example, if you
use -p10 and want to print just the second page,
you would need to specify -o11.
<HR>
<CODE>Command line:&nbsp;</CODE>
<B>-r</B>
<BR>
<CODE>Mupmate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</CODE>
Config &gt; Registration Form
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>

Print a copy of the
<A HREF="register.html">Mup shareware registration form</A>


to standard output.
<HR>
<CODE>Command line:&nbsp;</CODE>
<A NAME="soption"><B>-s</B> <I>stafflist</I></A>
<BR>
<CODE>Mupmate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</CODE>
Run &gt; Set Options &gt; Staffs to Display/Play
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>

Only print the staffs that are included in <I>stafflist</I>.
The <I>stafflist</I> can be a
comma-separated list of staff numbers or ranges, such as &quot;1,5&quot; or &quot;1-3,7-8&quot;
but no spaces are allowed in the list.
If the -m or -M option is also used, to produce
<A HREF="midi.html">MIDI output,</A>
this option controls which staffs are played rather than which
are printed.
If you want only a single voice to be printed or played, you can follow
a staff number or range with <B>v1</B> or <B>v2</B> or <B>v3</B>
to restrict to voice 1, 2 or 3
respectively, such as &quot;1v2&quot; or &quot;1-4v1,5-6v2&quot;. Otherwise
all voices on the staff are printed or played. 
You can't specify a list or range for voices;
if you only want to make two out of three voices visible,
you have to specify them separately, like &quot;1v2,1v3&quot;.
<A HREF="param.html#visible">See also the "visible" parameter.</A>

Print the Mup version number. When invoked from command line,
Mup will then exit. This document is for version 5.8.
<HR>
<CODE>Command line:&nbsp;</CODE>
<A NAME="xoption"><B>-x</B><I>M</I><B>,</B><I>N</I></A>
<BR>
<CODE>Mupmate:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</CODE>
Run &gt; Set Options &gt; Extract Measures
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>

Extract measures <I>M</I> through <I>N</I> of the song. This allows you to print
or play a part of a song. The comma and second value are optional;
if not specified, the default is to go to the end of the piece.
Positive values specify the number of measures from the beginning of the piece,
while negative values are relative to the end, with -1 referring to the
last measure of the song.
So -x1,-1 means the entire song, if the song doesn't have a pickup measure.

If the song has a pickup measure, that is specified by 0.
So for a song with a pickup, -x0,-1 would mean the entire song,
and -x0,0 would mean just the pickup measure.
As other examples, -x-1,-1 means just the final measure of the song,
-x2 means starting after the first full measure, -x3,4 means only
measures 3 and 4, and -x6,6 means just measure 6.
The starting measure is not allowed to be inside an ending.
A common use for this option might be to
<A HREF="midi.html">generate a MIDI file</A>
for just a few measures. For example, if you were
trying to tweak tempo values for a ritard in the last 2 measures of a song,
you could use -x-2 to listen to just those measures.
<HR>
</P>
<P>
When invoked from command line, the options, if any,
can be followed by one or more <I>files</I> in the format
described in this User's Guide. If no <I>files</I> are specified,
standard input is read.
If several <I>files</I> are listed, they are effectively concatenated together
and treated as one big file. Since there are some things (such as
<A HREF="headfoot.html">header and footer)</A>


that are only allowed to occur once, if you have several independent
pieces, Mup should be called on each individually rather than trying to
print them all with one command.
If a specified file does not exist, and its name does not already end
with .mup or .MUP, then Mup will append .mup to the specified name and
attempt to open that.
</P>
<P>
If you just want to create a PostScript output file, for printing on a
PostScript printer, or viewing with a tool such as GSview, you can
use the -f option, as in
<BR><PRE>
    mup -f outfile.ps infile.mup
</PRE><BR>
Or on Unix, Linux or MS-DOS command window,
you could redirect the output into a
file using the &gt; character, as in:
<BR><PRE>
    mup infile.mup &gt; outfile.ps
</PRE><BR>
</P>
<P>
For more debugging, in addition to the
<A HREF="cmdargs.html#dbgoption">-d option,</A>
if the environment variable MUP_BB is set to &quot;bcfgnsu&quot; or any subset
of those letters, the generated output will include &quot;bounding
boxes&quot; for the things Mup internally calls bars (b), chords (c), feeds (f),
grpsyls (g), header/footer and top/bottom (h),
notes (n), staffs (s), and stuff (u).
While this is intended for use in debugging Mup itself, it may also
help you understand why Mup places things the way it does,
since in general, Mup only allows bounding boxes to overlap according
to specific rules. If viewed with a color PostScript viewer (not
<A HREF="utilpgms.html">Mupdisp,</A>
which is covered below), these boxes will be in color.
