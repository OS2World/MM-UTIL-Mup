Adjusting Output
</H2>
<P>

Mup does its best to lay out the music in an aesthetically pleasing way.
Often, however, you may want to make adjustments. Perhaps the last part of
a piece spilled over onto a third page and you'd like to squeeze it all on
two pages, or a page turn falls at an awkward spot. There are several
mechanisms available for making adjustments. They have already been discussed
individually in various sections of this document, but this section tries to
pull things together.

<P>
<A HREF="newscore.html">The "newscore" or "newpage" commands</A>


can be used to force where breaks occur.
This may be useful for ensuring a section ends at the end of a score or page.
</P>
<P>
If you want to get a little more or less on each page, it is usually best
to start with changing the
<A HREF="param.html#scale">scale,</A>
<A HREF="param.html#stscale">staffscale,</A>

<A HREF="param.html#packfact">packfact,</A>

and/or
<A HREF="param.html#packexp">packexp</A>

parameters.

You may want to experiment with changing these individually first, to get
a feel for how they work, as trying to change all of them at once may lead to
interactions that change things more radically than you might expect.
Changing staffscale in score context lets you adjust the size of the
music without affecting the size of the text in headers and footers.
Adjusting the margins is sometimes helpful as well. Other parameters which

might be useful in some situations are:
<A HREF="param.html#maxscore">maxscores,</A>
<A HREF="param.html#scorepad">scorepad,</A>

<A HREF="param.html#scoresep">scoresep,</A>

<A HREF="param.html#staffpad">staffpad,</A>
and
<A HREF="param.html#staffsep">staffsep.</A>

</P>
<P>
The
<A HREF="param.html#dist">dist,</A>

<A HREF="param.html#dyndist">dyndist,</A>
and
<A HREF="param.html#chdist">chorddist</A>

parameters are useful if
you want items to line up vertically.
The &quot;align&quot; and &quot;dist&quot; option can be used
on rom, bold, ital, boldital, octave, mussym, crescendo and decrescendo
statements, to force something where you want it.
(The &quot;dist&quot; option can be used on rehearsal marks as well.)

<P>
The appearance of lyrics can be adjusted using the
<A HREF="param.html#lyrdist">lyricsdist,</A>

<A HREF="param.html#lyrfont">lyricsfont,</A>
<A HREF="param.html#lyrfam">lyricsfontfamily,</A>
<A HREF="param.html#lyrsize">lyricssize,</A>
and
<A HREF="param.html#lyralign">lyricsalign</A>
parameters.
