Mupdisp and Mupprnt utility programs
</H2>
<P>

If you are using Ghostscript, but prefer to not use Mupmate,
there are two utility programs included with
Mup for displaying and printing music.

<BR><PRE>
mupdisp <I>Mup_options myfile</I>
</PRE><BR>

will display music to your screen, while
<BR><PRE>
mupprnt <I>Mup_options myfile</I>
</PRE><BR>
will print the output to your printer.

See the installation instructions for more details on configuring the
Mupprnt program for your printer.
</P>
<P>
The <I>Mup_options</I> can be any of the options listed in the
section on
<A HREF="cmdargs.html">"Command line arguments"</A>

except -C, -E, -f, -F, -m, -M, -r, or -v, which don't
send PostScript output to the standard output.

</P>
<P>
The Mupdisp program allows you to view pages in any order, with either a
version small enough to fit on your screen or a near-actual-size version

that you can scroll if it doesn't fit on your screen.

Mupdisp will run under MS-DOS/Windows or will run under

UNIX with TERM of AT386, linux, or xterm (under X windows). 

</P>
<P>
Mupdisp begins in partial page mode,
which displays output at approximately actual size (depending
on the size of your monitor). In this mode, it is possible that
not all of the page fits on the
screen, so the scrolling commands can be used to move up and down to view
different parts of the page. In full page mode, a small version of the
entire page is displayed.  This is useful
for seeing overall page layout, but is generally too small to see much detail.
This mode is now somewhat of a relic of the days when screens were typically
much smaller than they are today, and is thus becoming less useful.
</P>
<P>
Once the music has been drawn on the screen, you can enter various commands
to view different pages or parts of the current page.
The commands are:
<DL>
<DT><I>num</I> &lt;Enter&gt;
<DD>
Go to page number <I>num</I>.
<DT>+ or &lt;space&gt; or &lt;control-E&gt; or &lt;control-F&gt;
<DD>
move forward on the page by about 1/8 of an inch
(partial page mode only)
<DT>- or &lt;backspace&gt; or &lt;control-Y&gt; or &lt;control-B&gt;
<DD>
move backward on the page by about 1/8 of an inch
(partial page mode only)
<DT>b or &lt;control-U&gt; or &lt;control-P&gt;
<DD>
move backward on the page by about an inch
(partial page mode only)
<DT>f or &lt;Enter&gt; or &lt;control-D&gt; or &lt;control-N&gt;
<DD>
move forward on the page by about an inch
(partial page mode only)
<DT>h or ?
<DD>
display help screen
<DT>m
<DD>
toggle between partial page and full page modes.
<DT>n
<DD>
go to next page
<DT>p
<DD>
go to previous page
<DT>q or ZZ
<DD>
quit
<DT>r
<DD>
Repaint the page (useful for exiting help page)
</DL>
</P>
<P>
When in X windows, the mouse can be used for scrolling. The left button scrolls

downward like the f command, while the right button scrolls backwards like
the b command.
