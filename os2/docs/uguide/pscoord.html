Passing multiple coordinates to PostScript
</H2>
<P>
When you use a &quot;postscript&quot; section to add arbitrary PostScript code to
the Mup output, you specify a current point, but sometimes it would be
useful for the PostScript code to know about the location of more than
one thing on the page, for example, to draw a line between two points, or
to draw a box or oval around several chords. One way to do that is to
have one postscript section to save away the X,Y values of each point of
interest, and then have a final postscript section that uses the points to
draw something. Since Mup puts the contents of postscript sections inside
a save/restore block, saving coordinate information for later use is a
little tricky, but the following example shows one way it can be done.
Earlier, in the
<A HREF="macros.html#arrow">section on macros,</A>
we showed how to draw a line with an arrow using macros
and arithmetic expressions.
Here we will show how to accomplish a similar thing using a postscript section.
