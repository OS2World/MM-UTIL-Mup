Contexts
</H2>

<P>
There is always a current Mup &quot;context&quot; that is in effect.
When Mup begins reading input, it is operating in &quot;music&quot; context, which
is where music, lyrics, barlines, and other related things

are described. You can change to another
context by entering its name. A context remains in effect until
another context is named.
The contexts are:
<DL>
<DT>
<A HREF="headfoot.html">header</A>
<DD>
to define what goes at the top of the first page, typically
the title, composer, etc.
<DT>
<A HREF="headfoot.html">footer</A>
<DD>
to define what goes at the bottom of the first page,
typically a copyright notice, performance notes, etc.
<DT>
<A HREF="headfoot.html">header2</A>
<DD>
to define what is to be printed on the top of pages after the first page.
<DT>
<A HREF="headfoot.html">footer2</A>
<DD>
to define what is to be printed on the bottom of pages after the first page.
<DT>
<A HREF="headfoot.html">top</A>
<DD>
to define what is to be printed on the top of page.
This gets printed below the header (or header2), if any.
If the output is not already at the beginning of a new page,
a new page is started.
Unlike header, which can only be used once, and is used only on the very
first page, top can be used multiple times. In a song with multiple movements,
you might use top to put a title at the beginning of each movement.
<DT>
<A HREF="headfoot.html">bottom</A>
<DD>
to define what is to be printed on the bottom of page.
This gets printed above the footer (or footer2), if any.
If the output is not already at the beginning of a new page,
a new page is started.
Unlike footer, which can only be used once, and is used only on the very
first page, bottom can be used multiple times.
<DT>
<A HREF="headfoot.html">top2</A>
<DD>
to define what is to be printed on the top of pages
after the page that uses &quot;top.&quot;
If the output is not already at the beginning of a new page,
a new page is started.
<DT>
<A HREF="headfoot.html">bottom2</A>
<DD>
to define what is to be printed on the bottom of pages
after the page that uses &quot;bottom.&quot;
If the output is not already at the beginning of a new page,
a new page is started.
<DT>
<A HREF="prnttext.html#block">block</A>
<DD>
to define a block that contains text rather than music.
<DT>
score
<DD>
to define
<A HREF="param.html">parameters</A>
that apply to the entire score.
<DT>
staff <I>S</I>
<DD>
to define
<A HREF="param.html">parameters</A>
to be used for staff <I>S</I>,
where <I>S</I> is a number from 1 to 40.
You can also specify a comma-separated list of staffs or staff ranges:
<PRE>
   staff 3,7	// staffs 3 and 7
   staff 1-2, 5-8, 10	// staffs 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10
</PRE>
<DT>
voice <I>S V</I>
<DD>
to define
<A HREF="param.html">parameters</A>
for a particular voice <I>V</I> on staff <I>S</I>.
The voice <I>V</I> can be either 1, 2, or 3.
<I>S</I> is a staff number from 1 to 40.
Multiple staffs and/or voices can be specified:
<PRE>
  voice 1-4 1	// voice 1 on staffs 1 through 4
  voice 1-2 2 &amp; 3 1	// voice 2 on staffs 1 and 2 and voice 1 on staff 3
</PRE>
<DT>
<A HREF="textmark.html#grids">grids</A>
<DD>
to define grids (typically for guitar)
<DT>
<A HREF="shaped.html">headshapes</A>
<DD>
to define what note head shapes to use for notes of various durations.
This context is rarely used, and is described in the chapter on
<A HREF="shaped.html">shaped notes.</A>
<DT>
<A HREF="music.html">music</A>
<DD>
to define everything else. This includes
<A HREF="chordinp.html">notes,</A>
<A HREF="lyrics.html">lyrics,</A>
<A HREF="bars.html">bar lines,</A>
<A HREF="phrase.html">phrase marks,</A>
<A HREF="textmark.html">tempo and dynamic marks, etc.</A>
</DL>
</P>
<P>
Most contexts are optional. An input file
just needs to contain either at least one measure of music
or at least one

<A HREF="prnttext.html#block">block.</A>
<A HREF="headfoot.html">The header, footer, header2, and footer2</A>
contexts may be placed anywhere in the file, but each can be used only once.
The other contexts may appear any number of times
in any order, and the order in which they occur is significant in
determining the output produced.
