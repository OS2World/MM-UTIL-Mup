Chant
</H2>
<P>
Chant typically uses an irregular number of beats per measure, or often
no measures at all in the normal sense. Mup checks to make sure you
provide enough notes to fill the time signature, but will allow you to use
less, filling the remainder with space. So one possible approach to writing
chant is to specify a large time signature--at least as big as you will
ever have on any given line of music--and then supplying as many notes
as you need, letting Mup pad with space as needed. If the warnings are
annoying, you can set the
<A HREF="param.html#warn">warn parameter</A>
to turn the warnings off.
