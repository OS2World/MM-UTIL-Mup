Phrase marks
</H2>

<P>
While it may often be more convenient to
<A HREF="ichdattr.html#phrase">specify phrase marks using "ph" and "eph" in the music input,</A>
you can also use the phrase statement.
</P>
<P>
If there is only one voice, specifying <I>place</I> for a phrase just tells

Mup where to draw the phrase mark. If there are
<A HREF="param.html#vscheme">two or more voices,</A>
and a <I>place</I> is specified, &quot;above&quot;


indicates to Mup that the phrase is associated with voice 1,
and &quot;below&quot; indicates to Mup that the phrase is associated with voice 2.

</P>
<P>
If no <I>place</I> is specified and there is only one voice with notes,
Mup will decide which side would be better based on the musical data.
This means the phrase mark may come out above or below.
In the case where there are two voices and
there are notes present in both voices, phrase marks will be drawn both
above and below.
</P>
<P>
Each phrase statement item must include a begintime and duration.


A phrase mark must begin and end on a chord, so Mup first takes the begintime

and duration and finds the chords nearest to each of them. It then draws a
phrase mark between them, shaping it to be out of the way of other things as
much as possible.
It is possible to specify a &quot;grace back up&quot; on the begintime or endtime
to make the phrase start or end on a grace note.
This is done by giving a negative number in parentheses,
specifying how many grace notes to back up.
It is possible to &quot;nest&quot; phrase marks (i.e., have one phrase on a subset of
the chords of another phrase).

<P>
The word &quot;phrase&quot; can be preceded by a line type modifier: dotted or dashed.
The dotted or dashed styles might be used for phrase marks
that were added by an editor rather than the composer, or to show a phrase
that doesn't apply to all verses.
