Placing verses below the scores
</H2>
<P>
Sometimes, particularly with songs that have a lot of verses,

you may want to put some verses of lyrics as blocks of
text below the music. Probably the easiest way to do this
is using &quot;print&quot; or &quot;paragraph&quot; statements inside

<A HREF="prnttext.html#block">a "block."</A>
<BR><PRE>
block
print (_win.w + 30, _win.n - 15) &quot;2.   &quot;
print &quot;\
Here is the first line
and the second line
and the third line.
&quot;
print (_win.w + 90, _win.n - 15) &quot;3.   &quot;
print &quot;\
Here is another verse's first line
and its second line
and its third line.
&quot;
</PRE><BR>

You may need to use a little trial-and-error to determine the
coordinates to use on the print statements,
but you only have to determine one coordinate per verse,
and with a bit of practice it gets easier to find the right values.
Since the &quot;print&quot; statement is being used, the font and size will be
determined by the
<A HREF="param.html#size">size parameter</A>
and
<A HREF="param.html#font">font parameter,</A>
rather than by
<A HREF="param.html#lyrsize">lyricssize</A>
and
<A HREF="param.html#lyrfont">lyricsfont.</A>

If you also want chords symbols with these verses,
you can do that too. It is easiest if you use Courier font,
as shown in the example below, since its constant-width characters
make it easy to line things up. If you use a proportional-width font,
you will have to determine how to place the chords by trial and error.

print (_win.w + 50, _win.n - 35) &quot;3.   &quot;
print &quot;\f(CR)\
C            D7    G7
This is the first line
C       F
of the next verse
B\(smflat)
of the song.
