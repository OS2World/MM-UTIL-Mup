Bar lines
</H2>
<P>

Each measure must be ended with a &quot;bar&quot; of some kind. There are several kinds:

<TABLE BORDER=4>
<TR>
<TD><B>Keyword</B></TD>	<TD><B>Meaning</B></TD>

</TABLE>

</P>
<P>
In addition, the bar and dblbar types can be preceded


by the word &quot;dashed&quot; or &quot;dotted&quot; to produce dashed or dotted bar lines.

<P>
When a repeatstart would end up at the end of a score,
it will automatically get moved to the beginning of the following score.
In that case, it isn't clear what kind of bar line you would like to
have put at the end of the original score. By default, Mup will use
an ordinary bar, but in some cases--like if the repeatstart begins
a new section, or there is also a key change--you might want to have
a dblbar instead. You can get a dblbar there by specifying dblbar in
parentheses before the repeatstart:
<BR><PRE>
(dblbar) repeatstart
</PRE><BR>
Actually, you are allowed to specify any bar type in the parentheses,
including dashed or dotted types,
but dblbar or possibly invisbar are probably the only ones likely to be useful.
If the repeatstart ends up in the middle of a score, so that it doesn't
need to get moved to the beginning of the next score, the parenthesized
bar type is not needed, so it is just ignored.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes music is printed without bar lines. The &quot;invisbar&quot; can be used in
this case, to fulfill Mup's requirement to specify some sort of bar after
every measure without actually printing bar lines.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="restart">The restart is a special kind of bar.</A>

It follows immediately after another
bar line without any intervening music data. (That is, you can't have
any notes. You can use score or staff context things, like changing time or
key signature.) It would be most commonly used for something like a short coda.

<P>
There are several optional directives that can follow the bar line keyword.
They can be specified in any order and are described below.
</P>
<H3>
Bar line padding
</H3>
<P>
<A NAME="bpad">One optional directive is padding.</A>

It can be used to force Mup to place extra white space to

the left of the bar line. It is specified by the keyword &quot;pad&quot; followed

by a number of stepsizes of padding to add. For example:
<BR><PRE>
dblbar pad 3
</PRE><BR>
would add 3 stepsizes of padding.
</P>
<H3>
Bar line location tag
</H3>
<P>
<A NAME="btag">It is also possible to associate a</A>
<A HREF="tags.html">location tag</A>

with a bar line.
For example:
<BR><PRE>
// Associate tag &quot;_bar6&quot; with bar line
bar =_bar6

// Do double bar with an extra stepsize of
// padding, and associate tag &quot;q&quot;
// with the bar line
dblbar pad 1 =q
</PRE><BR>
</P>
<P>
The y coordinate of a bar line is not very useful. Special rules apply if
a bar line happens to be placed at the end of a score. Any locations taken

relative to the bar that would be to the right of the bar are treated as
if the bar line were at the beginning of the following score,
just beyond the clef and time and key signatures, if any.



</P>
<H3>
Endings
</H3>
<P>
<A NAME="endings">First and second endings, etc. can be designated at bar lines.</A>

This is done with the keyword &quot;ending,&quot; followed by a
quoted string to use as the label for the ending that should begin at the


bar line. An ending will span bars until either another ending is specified,
the piece ends, or the
special keyword &quot;endending&quot; is used. Examples:
<BR><PRE>
bar ending &quot;1.&quot;
repeatend ending &quot;2-3&quot;
endbar endending
</PRE><BR>
</P>
<P>
The ending label will always be
forced into 12 point times roman font. If you change font or size or include



special characters in the ending label,
the output is not likely to be aligned properly.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="param.html#endingst">The "endingstyle" parameter</A>

controls where endings are placed.
Endings cannot start at or cross over a restart bar.
</P>
<H3>
Rehearsal marks
</H3>
<P>
<A NAME="reh">Rehearsal letters or numbers</A>

can be specified on any bar line. There are four formats:
<BR>
<B>rehearsal let</B>
<BR>
<B>rehearsal num</B>
<BR>
<B>rehearsal mnum</B>
<BR>
<B>rehearsal &quot;</B><I>label</I><B>&quot;</B>

</P>
<P>
In the first example, a rehearsal letter will be placed on the bar. The
first occurrence of this will become rehearsal &quot;A&quot;, the next &quot;B&quot;, and so
forth. The second format works in a similar fashion except that numbers are
used rather than letters. With the third format, the current measure

number is used. With the last format, any arbitrary string

within the quotes will be used. The keyword &quot;rehearsal&quot; can be
abbreviated to &quot;reh&quot; if you wish. Only one rehearsal mark is allowed on
any one bar, but the types can be mixed throughout the composition.
Note, however, that mixing &quot;num&quot; with &quot;mnum&quot; is likely to be very confusing,
as would using &quot;num&quot; while the
<A HREF="param.html#measnum">measnum parameter</A>
is set to &quot;every <I>N</I>.&quot;
The rehearsal marks can be intermixed with other bar options:
<BR><PRE>
1: 1c;
dblbar reh num ending &quot;1&quot;
1: 1e;
repeatend pad 1 =_xyz reh let ending &quot;2.&quot;
1: 1g;
bar rehearsal &quot;Duet&quot;
1: 1ce;
endbar endending
</PRE><BR>
<IMG SRC="mugex38.gif" ALT="Picture of Mup output"><BR>
</P>
<P>
The rehearsal marks are normally put directly above the bar
line. However, if the bar line falls at the end of a score, the rehearsal

mark will be placed at the beginning of the following score, after the
<A HREF="param.html#clef">clef,</A>


<A HREF="param.html#key">key signature,</A>
and
<A HREF="param.html#time">time signature.</A>
<A HREF="param.html#endingst">The "endingstyle" parameter</A>

is used to determine which staffs get rehearsal marks.
<A HREF="param.html#rehstyle">The "rehstyle" parameter</A>
specifies whether to put rehearsal marks inside a box or a circle
or leave them plain.
</P>
<P>
The rehearsal keyword may be followed by a specification for <I>fontfamily</I>,
<I>font</I>, and/or <B>(</B><I>size</I><B>)</B>.
Once specified, these remain in effect
for any future rehearsal marks, until explictly changed. Some examples:
<BR><PRE>
bar rehearsal helvetica bold (14) let
repeatend reh newcentury num
invisbar reh rom (10) mnum
</PRE><BR>
</P>
<P>
After all the options listed above, you may specify &quot;dist <I>N</I>&quot; where
<I>N</I> is some number of stepsizes. This will override the
<A HREF="param.html#dist">dist parameter</A>
for determining how close to the staff to place the rehearsal mark.
If the number is followed by a &quot;!&quot; Mup will place the mark exactly
that far from the top of the staff, even if it overwrites other things;
otherwise the value specifies a minimum distance.
<BR><PRE>
rehearsal num dist 5     // at least 5 stepsizes away
reh bold &quot;A1&quot; dist 2 !   // exactly 2 stepsizes away
</PRE><BR>
</P>
<H3>
Setting the measure number
</H3>
<P>
<A NAME="setmnum">Mup keeps track of</A>
<A HREF="param.html#measnum">measure numbers</A>

automatically, but sometimes you may want
to override this to set the current measure number to some specific value.
This is done by adding mnum=<I>number</I> on a bar line,
which will set the current measure number to the given <I>number</I>.
<BR><PRE>
// Set the current measure number to 50
dblbar mnum=50
</PRE><BR>
</P>
<H3>
Setting rehearsal letter or number
</H3>
<P>
<A NAME="setreh">If you are using the "rehearsal let" or "rehearsal num" styles,</A>
you can set those to specific values too, similarly to how mnum can be set.
This might be useful, for example, if you have a single input file that
contains multiple songs or movements, and you want the rehearsal marks
to start over at the beginning of each song or movement.
</P>
<P>
The rehearsal number can be set on any bar line using num=<I>N</I>, where
<I>N</I> is a number, typically 1.
<BR><PRE>
bar num=1
</PRE><BR>
The rehearsal letter can be set in a similar way, using let=&quot;<I>X</I>&quot; where
<I>X</I> is either a single upper case letter, A to Z, or two upper case
letters, AA to ZZ.
<BR><PRE>
dblbar let=&quot;A&quot; reh let
</PRE><BR>
</P>
<H3>
Hiding time/key signature and clef changes
</H3>
<P>
<A NAME="hide">Generally in printed music, when a</A>
<A HREF="param.html#time">time signature</A>

<A HREF="param.html#key">or key signature</A>

change occurs at the beginning of a score, these changes are also printed at
the very end of the previous score,
to make it clear there is a change coming up.
Mup normally does this, but occasionally you may not want that behavior.
Sometimes you may want to make a new score appear like the beginning
of a new piece. If you wish to suppress the printing of time signature,
key signature, and clef
changes at the end of the preceding score,
you can use the &quot;hidechanges&quot;

keyword on the bar line at which the changes occur.
Hidechanges cannot be used on a restart bar.
<BR><PRE>
1: c;d;e;f;
bar
// change time/key with normal treatment

newscore
score time=5/4 ; key = 1&amp;
music
1: d;e;f;2g;
// don't show changes at end of previous score
bar hidechanges	

newscore

score time=6/4 ; key = 2#
music
1: d;e;f;2.g;
bar
</PRE><BR>
<IMG SRC="mugex39.gif" ALT="Picture of Mup output"><BR>
</P>
<P>
There is a
<A HREF="param.html#brktrpts">bracketrepeats parameter</A>
that can be set that will cause Mup to draw brackets around repeated sections,
to make them more obvious to the performer, which may be helpful when
playing in dimly lit areas.
