Cross-staff stems
</H3>
<P>
Sometimes, on music for instruments that use more than one staff,

you may want some of the notes of a chord to be printed on
the staff above or below, rather than using a lot of ledger lines.
You can specify this by putting the word &quot;with&quot; before the notes that
are to go on the other staff, and following those notes with &quot;above&quot; or &quot;below&quot;
to specify which is the other staff.
For example:
<BR><PRE>
score
	staffs=2
staff 2
	clef=bass
music

1: 1e+g+c++;
2: cc+; ee+; g with g+ above; with c+c++ above;
bar

1: cc+; g with g- below; e with e- below; with cc- below;
2: 1c-e-g-;
bar
</PRE><BR>

The notes for the other staff have to follow the notes on the normal staff in
the input.  As is shown in the example,
it is possible to have <I>all</I> the notes on the &quot;other&quot; staff, if you wish.
The octave is specified as if the note were on the normal staff;
Mup will automatically adjust appropriately for the other staff's clef.
Once in a while, Mup may not be able to figure out how to completely
avoid colliding with other notes; in that case you can use the
<A HREF="chrdattr.html#hoffset">horizontal offset</A>
that was described earlier.
</P>
<P>
For
<A HREF="midi.html">MIDI</A>
purposes, only the normal staff's key signature and accidentals are
considered, so if the other staff has a different
<A HREF="param.html#key">key signature</A>
or accidentals that should really apply to these notes, you will have
to supply accidentals explicitly.
