INTRODUCTION
</H1>
<P>
The music publisher program called &quot;Mup&quot; takes a text file describing
music as input, and generates PostScript*


output for printing that music.
The input file can be created using your favorite text editor, or with the
help of the companion Mupmate program, or generated
from any other source, such as another program. The input must be written
in a special language designed especially for describing music. The majority
of the Mup User's Guide is the explanation of this language and how to use it.
</P>

Mup has the power to print almost any kind of music, everything from
a single melody line to full orchestral or choral scores complete with

tempo and dynamic marks. In addition to standard 5-line staffs, it can handle
1-line staffs (typically used for percussion),
and tablature notation (typically used for guitar).
Because Mup can do so much, it takes a while to


master its entire language. However, it has built-in default values for
many things, so that you can start using it for simple songs after
<A HREF="basics.html">learning just the basics,</A>
then learn the more complicated features as you need them.
Mup also has an option to produce
<A HREF="midi.html">output in the standard Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) format.</A>

<P>
Mup is shareware. That means you may try it out before buying it, and that


you may make copies for others, but anyone who wants to keep and
use Mup must pay a shareware registration fee. Running Mup with the -r
option (or /r option for MS-DOS** or Windows**)

will print the
<A HREF="register.html">registration form,</A>
with the relevant information.
Or if you are using Mupmate, the menu-driven interface on top of Mup,
you can get the registration form from the Config Menu.
Anyone may download an unregistered copy of Mup via ftp from ftp.arkkra.com
or via a Web browser from www.arkkra.com.
Music generated by an unregistered copy of Mup will include a notice
stating the program is unregistered, but all the features of a registered
copy are included.
