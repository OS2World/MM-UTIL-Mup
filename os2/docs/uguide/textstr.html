TEXT STRINGS
</H1>
<P>
Text strings are used in many different ways.
A text string is enclosed in double quotes,
and can contain any combination of letters, numbers, spaces,
and punctuation.
It can contain a \n to indicate a newline or \b to indicate a backspace,

but otherwise cannot contain tabs or other
control characters. If you want a double quote mark inside a string, it
has to be preceded by a backslash, to indicate it is not ending the string:
<BR><PRE>
&quot;A \&quot;word\&quot; in quotes&quot;
</PRE><BR>
</P>
<P>
If you want an actual backslash in a string, it must be entered as two
backslashes.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="strcat">You can concatenate strings with a + sign. Thus the following are equivalent:</A>
<BR><PRE>
&quot;this is a string&quot;
&quot;this is &quot; + &quot;a string&quot;
</PRE><BR>
</P>

<IMG SRC="muschar.gif" ALT="music characters">
<BR>
<P>
Any of these music character names can be prefixed by &quot;sm&quot; to indicate a
smaller version of the character. For example, &quot;smup4n&quot; is a small quarter

note, as might be used for a &quot;cue&quot; note.


Small music characters are 0.65 times as big as regular characters.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="special">Various non-ASCII characters</A>
can be included in text strings. If you have a non-United States keyboard
which can produce characters listed in the table below
from the &quot;Latin-1&quot; alphabet, you can simply type them into strings as
you normally would. If you want a character that your keyboard does not
support, you can put them in strings
by using their names in a manner similar to the music characters.
For example, you can include an 'a' with an acute accent on it in


a string by using \(aacute), or an upside down question mark
using \(questiondown).
</P>
<P>
There are 2-character shortcut names for many
of the letters with diacritical marks. The shortcut names
consist of the letter and a character representing the diacritical mark.
So, for example, \(aacute) can also be specified
by just \(a'), \(Egrave) can also be specified by \(E`), \(ntilde)
can be specified as \(n~), and \(Ocircumflex)
can be specified as \(O^). The following table lists the diacritical mark
names, their shortcut symbols, and the list of available shortcut names
using those symbols:

<A NAME="space">One of the special characters</A>
is specified by \(space).

This character appears as a normal space on output, but is not treated
like a space when Mup is looking for word or syllable boundaries.
The most common use for this is probably in
<A HREF="lyrics.html">lyrics</A>
when you want several words to be sung on a single note.
Another use would be in cases where Mup would normally split up a long
string between words in order to avoid running off the edge of a page,
but you want to prevent that split.

Font and size changes
</H2>
<P>
<A NAME="fonts">Strings can also contain special codes to indicate changes in font or size.</A>


The font codes begin with \f, and
can either be spelled out, as in the first column of
the table below, or as the abbreviations given in the second column.
<PRE>
       Code              Abbr        Meaning

\f(avantgarde rom)      \f(AR)  Avant Garde roman font
\f(avantgarde bold)     \f(AB)  Avant Garde bold font

\f(boldital)	\f(X)	change to bold italics in the current family
</PRE>
Some of the
<A HREF="textstr.html#special">special characters</A>
look better in some fonts than others.  We have found that


a few older PostScript interpreters unfortunately don't always
implement all the special characters in all fonts, so if you have
one of those, you may want to see if a newer version is available
that corrects the problem.
</P>
<P>
If you need a font other than those Mup supports directly,
it is possible to override Mup's builtin fonts with other fonts.
This is described later in the
<A HREF="fontfile.html">section on "Installing other fonts."</A>
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="size">The point size can also be changed. (A "point" is about 1/72 of an inch.)</A>

<PRE>
   Code                   Meaning

\s(<I>N)</I>    change to point size <I>N</I>
\s(+<I>N)</I>   increase point size by <I>N</I> points
\s(-<I>N)</I>   decrease point size by <I>N</I> points
\s(PV) or \s(previous)	revert to previous size

</PRE>
The point size can range from 1 to 100. A font or size change will last until
changed or until the end of the string. Any subsequent strings will begin
with default font and size values, except in the case of
<A HREF="lyrics.html">lyrics,</A>

where font and size information is maintained separately
for each staff and verse, and carried forward from measure to measure, and
<A HREF="bars.html#reh">rehearsal marks,</A>
where the information is also carried forward.



The default values can be set as
<A HREF="param.html">described in the "Parameters" section. The</A>
<A HREF="textstr.html#symlist">music symbols</A>
are affected by size changes.
If a music symbol follows italics or bolditalics characters, it will be
made italics to match.
</P>
<P>
Here are some examples of strings:
<BR><PRE>
&quot;hello&quot;
&quot;( \(up2n) = 100 )&quot;
&quot;\f(TB)this will be bold. \f(TI)this will be italics&quot;
&quot;A \f(TX)\s(+12)BIG\f(PV)\s(-12) word&quot;
&quot;\f(newcentury boldital)Allegro&quot;
</PRE><BR>
</P>
<H2>
Horizontal and vertical motion
</H2>
<P>
It is also possible to specify a string that takes up more than one line,
by putting a &quot;\n&quot; where you want to move to a new line. The place where
this is most likely to be useful is for
<A HREF="param.html#label">staff labels,</A>

which you may want
to make multi-line, to keep them from becoming excessively wide.
For example:
<BR><PRE>
&quot;Violins\nI&amp;II&quot;
</PRE><BR>
</P>
<P>

A &quot;\b&quot; can be used to specify a backspace. This might be useful for

adding underlines to text.
If you wish to use letters with diacritical marks,

you will probably want to use the
<A HREF="textstr.html#special">special characters,</A>
described earlier in this section,
rather than trying to construct them using the plain letter,
a backspace, and the mark.
</P>
<P>
You are not allowed to back up to before the beginning of a line.
Note that in all fonts except Courier,
different characters have different widths, so
using backspaces can be a bit tricky. For example, underlining a 5-letter
word might require more than 5 underscores, if the characters in the word

are wider than an underscore character. In general, it works better to
enter an entire string, then backspace to add underscoring or accents, rather
than doing them along the way. For example, &quot;My\b\b___&quot; will line up
much better than &quot;M\b_y\b_&quot;.
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="vert">Vertical motion within a string</A>
can be specified using &quot;\v(<I>N</I>)&quot;

where <I>N</I> is some percentage of the current font height.
The distance may be negative for downward motion
or positive for upward motion, ranging from -100 to 100.

This might be used for creating superscripts and subscripts, although
the next section describes an alternate way of doing that which is
usually better. It might also be used just to line something up differently
than Mup normally would.
You cannot put newlines (with \n) in the same string with vertical
motion.
</P>
<H2>
Piled text, for superscripts, subscripts, etc.
</H2>
<P>
It is also possible to &quot;pile up&quot; lines of text in a string.
Some common uses of this could be for superscripts and subscripts or for

figured bass notation.
Some facilities to specifically deal with
<A HREF="textmark.html#chordmod">figured bass</A>
will be described in a later section, but
here we describe the general-purpose constructs for piling text. 

A \: is used to indicate the beginning of piling. Any subsequent
instances of \: in the same string will alternately turn piling off and on.
When a pile is begun, the text size is automatically made smaller, and
the text baseline is moved up, so that the first line of piled text is
like a superscript, and the next like a subscript. If there are additional
lines, they are placed below the subscript.
By default, the lines in a pile are placed such that the last digit
in each line all line up, or if there is no digit, the last character.
However, you can force different alignment.

A \| will force alignment at that point, or a \^ will force alignment
at the center of the following character. A maximum of one alignment marker
can be specified on each line of a pile.
You cannot put newlines (with \n) in the same string with piling.
A new line of the pile is started at each &lt;space&gt; character in the input string.
If you want an actual literal space inside a piled line, it must be
preceded with a backslash. As an example:
<BR><PRE>
&quot;Text\:superscript subscript\: back to normal.&quot;;
&quot;This pile \:has\ literal spaces\ in\ it.&quot;;
&quot;This pile \:h\^as align\|ment spec\^ified.&quot;;
</PRE><BR>
<IMG SRC="mugex65.gif" ALT="Picture of Mup output"><BR>
</P>
<H2>
Slash through number
</H2>
<P>
Another thing which is common in figured bass notation

is to draw a slash through a number. Again, the section on
<A HREF="textmark.html#chordmod">figured bass</A>
will describe how to do that inside figured bass,
but it is possible to put a slash through a number elsewhere by
placing a backslashed slash after a number, like this:
<BR><PRE>
	&quot;6\/&quot;
	&quot;10\/&quot;
</PRE><BR>
</P>
<H2>
Boxed or circled text
</H2>
<P>
<A NAME="boxed">You can cause the text to be</A>

printed inside a box by placing a \[ at
the beginning of the string and a \] at the end of the string.
Similarly you can cause text to be placed inside a circle (or ellipse
for strings that are wide) by placing a \{ at
the beginning of the string and a \} at the end of the string.
Boxed or circled text are not allowed in
<A HREF="lyrics.html">lyrics.</A>
<BR><PRE>
 &quot;\[This is in a box\]&quot;
 &quot;\{This is in an ellipse\}&quot;
