Include

<P>

The &quot;include&quot; statement can be used to include the contents of one file
inside another.
<BR><PRE>
<B>include &quot;</B><I>filename</I><B>&quot;</B>
</PRE><BR>
causes input to be read from the specified <I>filename</I>. When the end
of that file is reached, reading of input resumes from the original file
after the include statement.
</P>
<P>
If the <I>filename</I> cannot be found as is, and it is not an absolute
path, and if the environment variable MUPPATH is set, Mup will search
for the file in each directory listed in MUPPATH. On Unix systems, the
directories are separated by colons. On systems with DOS-like file naming
conventions, they are separated by semicolons.
The MUPPATH may be useful if, for example, you have a number of &quot;boilerplate&quot;
files that you want to include in lots of songs. You can put them in
some directory and set MUPPATH to list that directory, then any Mup
files you have can refer to them.
