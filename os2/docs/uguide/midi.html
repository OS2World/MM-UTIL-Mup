MIDI OUTPUT
</H1>
<P>

Mup will optionally produce MIDI output
<A HREF="cmdargs.html#moption">(using the -m command line argument).</A>

Mup is first and foremost a music publication program,
so its MIDI capabilities have a few limitations.
However, the MIDI output is quite useful for &quot;proofreading&quot;
(or perhaps we should say &quot;proof-listening&quot;).
It is often easier to spot a typo in Mup input by
listening to it than to look at the output. Mup provides enough MIDI
control to do virtually all of what MIDI supports, and will be adequate
for many people. Others however, may find they want a separate MIDI editor
for really serious MIDI work.
</P>
<P>
The following section assumes a general knowledge of MIDI. If you are not
familiar with MIDI, there are many books available on the subject
at most music stores or computer book stores.
There are also many online resources and tutorials.
You could start at
<A HREF="http://www.harmony-central.com/MIDI/Doc/doc.html">http://www.harmony-central.com/MIDI/Doc/doc.html</A>
or use your favorite search engine.
</P>
<P>
Each
<A HREF="param.html#vscheme">voice</A>

is put on a separate MIDI track. The first track contains


general information such as key and time signature. The next track will be for
staff 1, voice 1. If staff 1 has a second voice, that will be the next

track, otherwise it will be voice 1 of staff 2, if any, and so forth,
one track for each voice, top to bottom.


</P>
<P>
Output is in MIDI file format 1, with a default of 120 quarter notes
per minute, 192 ticks per quarter note. MIDI channel 1 is used by default for
all voices. If you want to use different instrument sounds for different
voices, you will need to specify a different channel for each voice, then
specify the MIDI &quot;program&quot; for that voice. This is demonstrated in some
of the examples later in this section.


</P>
<P>
Mup MIDI output will handle
<A HREF="bars.html">repeats</A>

and
<A HREF="bars.html#endings">first and second endings,</A>

but it does not know anything about &quot;D.S. al coda&quot; or anything of that sort. 

It is possible to work around this limitation to some extent using
<A HREF="macros.html">macros.</A>

For example, a section between a &quot;sign&quot; and a &quot;jump to coda&quot; symbol could
be put inside a macro definition, then the macro can be called. Then later
in the piece, where the &quot;D. S.&quot; occurs the macro can be called again if MIDI
is defined. For example:
<BR><PRE>
// an introductory section, ends with a sign
1: c;d;e;f;
mussym above all: 5 &quot;sign&quot;;
bar

// define macro for section between sign and
// symbol to &quot;jump to coda&quot;
define SECTION
1: g;a;g;;
mussym above all: 5 &quot;coda&quot;;
bar
@

// print/play the section just defined by
// the macro
SECTION

// now do the music up to the D.S.
1: e;f;2g;
ital above 1: 1 &quot;D. S. al Coda&quot;;
dblbar

// human player would now flip back to
// the sign, so do the MIDI equivalent:
// play that section again.
ifdef MIDI
	SECTION
endif

// now do the coda
1: e;d;2c;
rom above 1: 0 &quot;Coda&quot;;
endbar
</PRE><BR>

</P>
<P>
Mup mainly just outputs the note information.
Mup will recognize
<A HREF="octave.html">octave marks,</A>


and move notes up or down appropriately.
It recognizes
<A HREF="pedal.html">piano pedal marks.</A>

It does not attempt to interpret tempo or dynamics marks



specified by
<A HREF="textmark.html">"rom," "boldital," etc. or ornaments in</A>
<A HREF="mussym.html">"mussym" statement.</A>

It does not handle ties to a different voice.
It does interpret
<A HREF="bars.html#reh">rehearsal marks</A>

as cue points.
It handles
<A HREF="chrdattr.html#chstyle">grace notes,</A>

<A HREF="roll.html">rolls,</A>
<A HREF="chrdattr.html#slashes">slashes,</A>

and
<A HREF="ichdattr.html#alt">alternation groups.</A>

You can control how legato the music is by using
<A HREF="param.html#release">the Mup "release" parameter.</A>
</P>
<P>
Some styles of music are often
 
written in &quot;swing time,&quot; meaning the
players are expected to play pairs of notes with the first twice
as long as the second, even though they are written as if they were the
same duration, or as if the first were three times as long as the second.
The most common example would be where the written notation shows
two eighth notes like 8;; or a dotted rhythm like 8.;16;
but the musician &quot;knows&quot; that the composer really intended it
to be played as if it were a triplet {4;8;}3;
The
<A HREF="param.html#swing">swingunit</A>
parameter can be used to get Mup MIDI output to automatically follow
that performance convention.
</P>
<P>
A MIDI editing program will probably be necessary to add some effects.
However, it is possible to specify certain directives for MIDI.
They are of the form:
<BR><PRE>
<B>midi</B> <I>S V</I><B>:</B> <I>begintime &quot;keyword=value&quot;;</I>
</PRE><BR>

The <I>S</I> and <I>V</I> specify the staff and voice for which the directive is

to apply. As elsewhere in Mup, an omitted voice will default to voice 1,
and both staff and voice can be given as a list.
Certain keywords apply to the entire score. In that case the form


<BR><PRE>
<B>midi all:</B> <I>begintime &quot;keyword=value&quot;;</I>
</PRE><BR>
is used instead.
The items specified using &quot;all&quot; are placed on the first track, the track
containing score-wide information. They are not applied to the
voices on the other tracks.
</P>
<P>
The <I>begintime</I>, as elsewhere in Mup,
gives the beat into the measure where the MIDI output is to be placed.


If notes are to be turned on or off at the same instant in time as the
<I>begintime</I>, first all &quot;note off&quot; commands are generated, then the &quot;midi&quot;
command events, then &quot;note on&quot; commands.
</P>
<P>
The <I>keyword=value</I> gives specific information of
what MIDI output to generate. The following keywords are currently supported:
<TABLE BORDER=4>

</TABLE>

</P>
<P>
The keywords can be abbreviated to their first three or more letters,
except &quot;chanpressure&quot; which requires at least five letters to differentiate
it from &quot;channel&quot; (&quot;cha&quot; or &quot;chan&quot; will be interpreted as channel).
In most cases, the &quot;=&quot; is followed by either a number or some text. Exceptions
to this are discussed in the next few paragraphs.
</P>
<P>
The &quot;parameter&quot; keyword is followed by 2 numbers, separated by a comma.

The first is the parameter number, the second is the parameter value.
Thus to set parameter 7 (which is the volume parameter) to 90 for voice
2 of staff 3, starting at the beginning of the measure, you can use:
<BR><PRE>
midi 3 2: 0 &quot;parameter=7,90&quot;;
</PRE><BR>
</P>
<P>
The &quot;onvelocity&quot; and &quot;offvelocity&quot; keywords can have one or more values,
separated by commas. If there is only one value, it applies to all notes
in each chord. If there is more than one value, the first value applies
to the top note of the chord, the second value to the second-from-the-top
note, and so forth. If there are more notes in a chord than there are
values specified, the last value specified applies to all of the remaining
notes. So, for example, if you want to emphasize the top note of each
chord because it is the melody, you can specify two values, as in
<BR><PRE>
midi 1: 1 &quot;onvelocity=76, 60&quot;;
</PRE><BR>
which would cause the top note to have a velocity of 76 and all other
notes to have a velocity of 60.
</P>
<P>
The &quot;hex&quot; form can be used to insert any arbitrary MIDI data into
the MIDI file. The value consists of any even number of hexadecimal digits.
Spaces and tabs can be included in the value field for readability.
</P>
<P>
Note that Mup uses the MIDI standard,
which numbers instruments from 0 through 127,
but some MIDI playback programs follow a convention of numbering them
from 1 through 128.
</P>
<P>
Here are some examples:
<BR><PRE>
midi all: 0 &quot;tempo=72&quot;;
midi 1-2 1-2: 0 &quot;channel=2&quot;; 0 &quot;program=14&quot;; 3.5 &quot;program=76&quot;;
midi all: 3 &quot;hex= ff 00 02 00 01&quot;;   // sequence number 1
midi 3,6: 0 &quot;channel=5&quot;; 0 &quot;prog=15&quot;; 0 &quot;instr=dulcimer&quot;;
// set parameter 7 (usually volume) to 100
midi 2: &quot;par = 7, 100&quot;;
</PRE><BR>
</P>
<P>
Here is a more extensive example of how midi commands might be used
in a song:
<BR><PRE>
score
	staffs=2
	vscheme=2o

staff 2
	clef=bass

voice 2 2
	// Make the bottom voice more staccato
	release=50

music

// Set the tempo.
// Start out at 108 quarter notes per minute,
// but on count 4, slow down to 96 per minute.
midi all: 0 &quot;tempo=108&quot;; 4 &quot;tempo=96&quot;;

// Put each voice on a different channel
// using a different instrument sound.
// The program numbers correspond to the
// General MIDI sounds as noted.
midi 1 1: 0 &quot;channel=1&quot;; 0 &quot;program=68&quot;;  //oboe
midi 1 2: 0 &quot;channel=2&quot;; 0 &quot;program=11&quot;;  //vibraphone
midi 2 1: 0 &quot;channel=6&quot;; 0 &quot;program=60&quot;;  //french horn
midi 2 2: 0 &quot;channel=4&quot;; 0 &quot;program=35&quot;;  //fretless bass

// Make the top voice louder, and put an
// accent on the third beat
midi 1 1: 0 &quot;onvelocity=86&quot;; 3 &quot;onvelocity=100&quot;; 4 &quot;onvel=86&quot;;

// Set maximum reverb on french horn part,
// starting at the second beat.
// (Reverb is parameter 91)
midi 2 1: 2 &quot;parameter=91, 127&quot;;

// Set chorus on oboe to 75, from the beginning.
// (Chorus is parameter 93)
midi 1 1: 0 &quot;param=93, 75&quot;;

// Pan the bass part to middle of left side.
// (Pan is parameter 10, with a value of 0 being hard left,
// 64 in the center, and 127 being hard right, so 32 is
// half way to the left.)
midi 2 2: 0 &quot;parameter=10, 32&quot;;

// Now the music to be played...
