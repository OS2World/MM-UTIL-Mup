MUP FILE STRUCTURE
</H1>
<P>
Mup files do not have to follow any naming convention,
although on systems that use file name suffixes to associate a file
with an application, it is traditional to use .mup for the suffix.
It can also be useful to put a special &quot;magic string&quot;
on the first line of Mup files.
This magic string is completely optional, but having it there
makes it easy for both people
and programs to identify the file as Mup input.
The standard recommended value for this string is:
<BR><PRE>
//!Mup-Arkkra
</PRE><BR>
with exactly that spacing and capitalization.
If the file uses features of newer versions of Mup, and thus would
not work with older versions, you can add a dash and
the minimim version number the file requires, as in:
<BR><PRE>
//!Mup-Arkkra-5.8
</PRE><BR>
</P>

Mup General Syntax
</H2>
<P>
Any number of spaces and tabs can be put in

almost anywhere except in the middle of a word.
Each statement goes on a separate line.
If for some reason you wish to split a statement onto several lines,
each but the last must end with a &quot;\&quot; (backslash) character, to

tell Mup to treat the next line as a continuation of the current line.
Blank lines can be put between statements to make things easier to read.
</P>
<P>
Comments begin with two slashes and continue to end of line. All comments

will be totally ignored by Mup, and are for your own use to remind yourself
of something. For example:
<BR><PRE>
// Note: in some early manuscripts, this chord had an accent
</PRE><BR>
</P>
<P>
Staffs are numbered from top to bottom, starting at staff 1.



</P>
<P>
Several different units are used for distances. One is inches or
centimeters. (There is a
<A HREF="param.html#units">units parameter</A>
that is used to select which you want to use.) Another

is &quot;stepsizes.&quot; One stepsize is half the distance between two staff lines.
In the horizontal dimension, &quot;counts&quot; are sometimes used. A &quot;count&quot;
refers to the musical duration of a note with a duration of the denominator


(bottom number) of the time signature.
The actual distance on the page will vary depending
on how Mup determines notes should be placed.
When you use a
<A HREF="param.html#time">time signature</A>
with two or more fractions added together,
as in 3/4 + 3/8, the &quot;count&quot; is the largest denominator, which would be
8 in the example just given.
</P>
<P>
Upper and lower case letters are not interchangeable. Thus, for example,
&quot;SCORE&quot; is not the same as &quot;score.&quot;
</P>
<P>
Most lines of input end with a semicolon. There are some kinds of input that

do not require an ending semicolon, but Mup will allow semicolons
on most of those
too, so that if you can't
remember if a given command requires a semicolon or not, you can just use one
anyway. For the examples in this User's Guide, semicolons are not used when
they are not necessary.*
<HR>
* For
<A HREF="param.html">setting and unsetting of parameters,</A>
either a semicolon or a newline
is required. For
<A HREF="bars.html">bar,</A>
<A HREF="multirst.html">multirest,</A>
<A HREF="prnttext.html">print, left, right, center, title,</A>
<A HREF="linecurv.html">line, curve,</A>
<A HREF="newscore.html">newscore, newpage,</A>
<A HREF="prnttext.html#postscript">postscript,</A>
and
<A HREF="prnttext.html#paragrph">paragraph,</A>
a newline is required, but it may optionally be preceeded by a semicolon.
For commands for changing
<A HREF="contexts.html">context,</A>
semicolon and newline are both optional,
but a newline is traditionally used to improve readability.
</P>
<P>
In
<A HREF="music.html">music context,</A>
newlines are required to separate commands: music data, bar lines, rolls,
commands to print strings, dynamic marks, lyrics, etc. all must each
end with a newline. In
<A HREF="textmark.html#grids">grids context</A>
and
<A HREF="shaped.html#hdshape">headshape context,</A>
each pair of strings must end with a newline.
In other contexts, there are a few cases where newlines between commands
are optional, although you may wish to use them anyway to improve readability.
</P>
<P>
Mup supports
<A HREF="macros.html">macros and conditionals (like 'if' and 'ifdef')</A>
that can be placed anywhere in input, except in the middle of words,
numbers, or strings; they needn't be on separate lines.
</P>
<P>
In a number of statements, Mup expects a text string. All strings must be

enclosed in double quotes. For example:
<BR><PRE>
&quot;This is a string.&quot;
&quot;Allegro&quot;
</PRE><BR>
</P>
<P>
A string can contain any combination of letters, numbers, spaces,
and punctuation.
It can also contain various things that will cause printing of special music
characters, change font and size, and so forth. Those things are covered in
<A HREF="textstr.html">the chapter on text strings.</A>
