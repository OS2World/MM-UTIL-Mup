Printing commands
</H2>

<P>
There are several commands for printing text.
There are four commands that have similar formats,
differing only in how they justify text.
<BR><PRE>
<B>print</B> <I>location</I> &quot;<I>text</I>&quot;
<B>left</B> <I>location</I> &quot;<I>text</I>&quot;
<B>right</B> <I>location</I> &quot;<I>text</I>&quot;
<B>center</B> <I>location</I> &quot;<I>text</I>&quot;
</PRE><BR>




</P>
<P>
The <I>location</I> is optional. If the <I>location</I> is omitted, the &quot;print&quot;
command will cause the <I>text</I> to be printed beginning at the current
horizontal and vertical location. The other commands will cause the text to
be placed vertically at the current vertical position, but left justified,
right justified, or centered within the current margins of the page.

</P>
<P>
The <I>location</I> can be specified using the special keyword of &quot;nl&quot;
which means &quot;next line.&quot; This moves the current location to the beginning
of the following line before placing the text. In other words, the current
vertical position is moved downward by the height of the current text

point size (or by as much as necessary
if the string is taller than that). Then
the <I>text</I> is printed on that line with the given justification style.
</P>
<P>
The other way to specify a <I>location</I> is by using coordinates.
The justification then takes place relative to the referenced location.
For example, consider the following &quot;right&quot; command containing a reference
to an absolute location:
<BR><PRE>
right (25, 4) &quot;something&quot;
</PRE><BR>
The y location given is 4. Since this is an absolute location with no location
tags being referenced, this means the vertical position will be 4 stepsizes from
the bottom of the page. The x location given is 25. Again, this is an
absolute location, so the current horizontal position will be 25 stepsizes from
the left edge of the page. Since right justification is indicated,
the word &quot;something&quot; will be placed such that the right edge of the final &quot;g&quot;
will be 25 stepsizes from the left edge of the page. If &quot;center&quot; had been
specified, the middle of the word &quot;something&quot; would be at the 25 stepsize point.
</P>
<P>
Here are some other examples:
<BR><PRE>
print &quot;Author unknown&quot;
center nl &quot;subtitle&quot;
left (h.x - 1.5, h.n + 2.3) &quot;Ad lib&quot;
right (_fine.e + time 3, _note.n + 5) &quot;Duet&quot;
</PRE><BR>
</P>
<P>
Another type of print command
is &quot;title.&quot; The full format of this command is:

<BR><PRE>
<B>title</B> <I>fontfamily font size  &quot;text1&quot;  &quot;text2&quot;  &quot;text3&quot;</I>
</PRE><BR>
However, only the word &quot;title&quot; and one quoted text string are required.

The <I>fontfamily</I>, if specified, has one of the values valid for
<A HREF="param.html#fontfam">the "fontfamily" parameter</A>
(avantgarde, bookman, courier, helvetica,
newcentury, palatino, or times). The default is the value of the &quot;fontfamily&quot;
parameter.

The <I>font</I>, if specified, has one of the values valid for the &quot;font&quot;
parameter (rom, bold, ital, or boldital). If no <I>font</I> is specified




the default is the value of
<A HREF="param.html#font">the "font" parameter.</A>
The optional <I>size</I> is a point size within parentheses.

If not specified, the default is the value of
<A HREF="param.html#size">the "size" parameter.</A>
</P>
<P>
In all cases, the location will be like that obtained via the &quot;nl&quot;
location to a print command. In other words, the title text string(s)
will be printed on the line below the location that was current when the
title command was encountered. If there is only one string given, it will
be centered between the margins. If two strings are given, both will be
printed on the same line, but the first will be left justified and the
second will be right justified. If three strings are given, they will all
be printed on the same line, with the first left justified, the second
centered, and the last right justified.
</P>
<P>
Some samples:
<BR><PRE>
title bold (12) &quot;Sonata 12&quot;
title (18) &quot;Song Without Words&quot;
title ital (12) &quot;Text: John Doe&quot; &quot;Tune: Jane Doe&quot;
title &quot;Suite in C&quot; &quot;Trumpet I&quot; &quot;Waltz&quot;
title    &quot;&quot;    &quot;A. Composer&quot;
</PRE><BR>
</P>
<P>
<A NAME="paragrph">The final command for printing text is</A>

the &quot;paragraph&quot; command.
This is used when you have a long section of text,
and you would like it to automatically wrap around onto as many
lines as necessary.
You can specify whether you want the right margin to be &quot;justified&quot; or &quot;ragged.&quot;
If you don't specify, the type of the previous paragraph is used.
The default for the very first paragraph is to be justified.
By default, the values of the
<A HREF="param.html#fontfam">fontfamily,</A>
<A HREF="param.html#font">font,</A>
and
<A HREF="param.html#size">size</A>
parameters are used to determine the text style, but any or all of those
parameters can be overridden on the paragraph command. The complete syntax is:
<BR>
 <I>justify_type</I> <B>paragraph</B> <I>fontfamily font</I> <B>(</B><I>size</I><B>) &quot;</B><I>string</I><B>&quot;</B>
<BR>
Only the keyword &quot;paragraph&quot; and the string are required.
Here are some example paragraphs:
<BR><PRE>
paragraph &quot;This is an example of a paragraph. Since no justification
type was specified, and this is the very first paragraph, the default
(justified) is used. A paragraph will wrap around
to as many lines as needed.
An explicit newline is given at the end of this paragraph,
to force a blank line between it and the following paragraph.\n&quot;

ragged paragraph avantgarde ital (15) &quot;This paragraph
is ragged rather than flush right. It is in a different font and size.
Ragged paragraphs are split onto multiple lines if necessary,
but they are not spread out to make lines go all the way to
the right margin.&quot;

justified paragraph (14) &quot;     Here is another paragraph.
This one is justified.
Only the size was specified for this paragraph; the font was not,
so the current default will be used.
Some spaces are included at the beginning of the paragraph text,
to create an indented first line for the paragraph.&quot;

paragraph &quot;Here is the final paragraph.
Since no justification type was given,
that of the previous paragraph (justified in this case) was used.
A paragraph may be used for many things,
such as describing how you want a piece to be performed,
or a biography of the composer.&quot;

<A NAME="block">Sometimes you may want to mix</A>
blocks of text with music.

This can be done by specifying a &quot;block&quot; context. The block context
will typically contain one or more &quot;paragraph&quot; commands, although any
of the printing commands (paragraph, print, left, center, right, or title)
can be used. The block can also contain changes in certain parameters, namely
<A HREF="param.html#font">font,</A>
<A HREF="param.html#size">size,</A>
and
<A HREF="param.html#fontfam">fontfamily,</A>
which will affect the appearance of
the following text. A block can also contain
<A HREF="newscore.html">"newscore" or "newpage" commands.</A>
Using &quot;newscore&quot; will cause vertical space to be added,
as would be used to separate scores. The amount of space is affected
by the
<A HREF="param.html#scoresep">scoresep</A>
and
<A HREF="param.html#scorepad">scorepad</A>
parameters. Using &quot;newpage&quot; will cause a new page to be started.
If a newscore or newpage includes a &quot;leftmargin&quot; specification,
that will alter the left margin on the block text that follows.
A &quot;rightmargin&quot; specification will alter the right margin
of the block text that precedes it.
</P>
<P>
Here is an example of a block.
<BR><PRE>
block
title bold &quot;Notation in Simple and Compound Meters&quot;
title &quot;&quot;
paragraph &quot;It is common for a person familiar
with mathematics but not with music to assume
that 3/4 and 6/8 time are equivalent,
but that is not the case.
In 3/4 time (which is known as simple triple meter),
a measure containing 3 quarter notes
would be notated like this:&quot;
score time=3/4
music
1: c;;;
bar hidechanges
block
paragraph &quot;whereas in 6/8 time
(which is compound duple meter),
a measure with 3 quarter notes should be notated thus:&quot;
score time=6/8
music
1: 4c;8~;;4;
bar

The printing commands may occur in the
<A HREF="headfoot.html">header, footer, header2, footer2, top, bottom, top2, bottom2,</A>




<A HREF="prnttext.html#block">block,</A>
and

contexts.


After each printing command,
the current location is set to the right edge of the last character printed
horizontally and at the baseline of the current line vertically.
</P>
<H2>
Including raw PostScript
</H2>
<P>
<A NAME="postscript">There is another command that looks a lot like the printing commands,</A>
but gives you a way to insert raw PostScript into the Mup output.
This might be used, for example,
to include a picture or logo along with your music.
The syntax is
<BR><PRE>
<B>postscript</B> <I>optional_location</I> <B>&quot;</B><I>raw PostScript</I><B>&quot;</B>
</PRE><BR>
As with the other print commands, if the location is omitted,
the current location is used.
</P>
<P>
The string is copied directly to the Mup output.
You can use the usual \&quot; to embed a double quote in the string,
but otherwise the string is copied exactly as it is,
enclosed inside a PostScript save/restore.
After the restore, the current location is reset back to where it
was originally.
</P>
<P>
Since the string is copied without any interpretation,
Mup does not reserve any space on the page for the PostScript,
and it is your responsibility to provide valid PostScript.
The PostScript language is beyond the scope of this User's Guide;
consult a book on PostScript if you need more information.
</P>
<P>
As a simple example, you might include an Encapsulated PostScript file
near the lower left corner of the current page using
<BR><PRE>
postscript &quot;50 50 translate (file.eps) run&quot;
</PRE><BR>
</P>
<P>
Or you could print a message in red italics
near the bottom of the page like this:
<BR><PRE>
postscript (70, 20) &quot;
              1 0 0 setrgbcolor
              /NewCenturySchlbk-Italic findfont
              16 scalefont setfont
              (Photocopying prohibited) show
              &quot;
