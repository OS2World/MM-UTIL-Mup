Octave marks
</H2>

<P>
Octave statements are used to mark notes that are to be played one or more

octaves higher or lower than written.  An &quot;octave above&quot; statement is

used to specify playing higher than written, or &quot;octave below&quot; for playing
lower than written. Each item must include a begintime



and a text string. The text string is most typically &quot;8va&quot; although Mup
will print whatever you say. For
<A HREF="midi.html">MIDI</A>
purposes, up to two digits at the beginning of the string are examined,
and a string starting with 8 will be treated as one octave,
15 or 16 will be treated as two octaves
(15 is really &quot;correct,&quot; but a few publishers may use 16), 22 or 24 as three
octaves, etc.  It will always default to be printed in 12-point
times ital font, although you can override that using the usual \f
and \s conventions.  If the octave

shifting applies to more than a single chord, there should also be a
duration specified, reaching to include the last affected note.  In this
case, Mup will draw a dashed line to mark the span affected. Note that



specifying the exact beat of a chord indicates the horizontal center of the
chord, so if you want the dashed line to reach a bit past the note, it
will be necessary to specify a duration slightly beyond the point of
the last chord to be included. Examples:
<BR><PRE>
1: 2f;g;
2: 2d+;g;
3: 2g;ce;
octave above 1: 2 &quot;8va&quot; til 1m + 1.3;
bar
1: 2a;c;
2: 2f;e;
3: 4f;;c;;
octave below 2: 1 &quot;8va&quot;;
octave below 3: 1 &quot;8va&quot; til 2.5; 3 &quot;15&quot; til 4.5;
