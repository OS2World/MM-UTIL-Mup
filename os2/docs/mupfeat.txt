       1.  The Mup Music Publication program

       Mup  is  a shareware music publication program.  Mup Version
       5.8 is now available in source form as well as  ready-to-run
       for MS-DOS/Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux x86.

       Music  is described by a text file that you can create using
       your favorite editor or the included Mupmate  program.   Mup
       then  determines  how  to  lay  out the music, and generates
       PostScript output for displaying or printing it.   It  is  a
       powerful  and  flexible  program,  which  has  been  used on
       thousands of  songs  in  a  wide  variety  of  styles,  both
       instrumental and vocal.

       Mup's features include:

         -- Up  to 40 staffs, which can include 1-line, 5-line, and
            tablature staffs.  Output  can  be  restricted  to  any
            subset   of   the  staffs.   Different  staffs  can  be
            different sizes.

         -- Up  to  3  independent  voices  per  staff,  up  to  70
            simultaneous notes per voice.

         -- Double  whole  to 256th notes, with any number of dots.
            Tuplets.

         -- Note styles of normal, grace,  cue,  X,  diamond,  plus
            shaped notes.  Optional parentheses around notes and/or
            accidentals.

         -- Cross-staff stems.

         -- Time signatures of cut, common, or numerators from 1 to
            99  and  denominators  from  1 to 64.  Complicated time
            signatures,  including  numerators  with  two  or  more
            numbers  added together, or two or more fractions added
            together, or alternating time signatures.

         -- All standard clefs, including treble, treble8, 8treble,
            French  violin,  soprano,  mezzosoprano,  alto,  tenor,
            baritone, and bass, as well as the drum (neutral) clef.
            Clefs can be changed in the middle of measures.

         -- Barline  styles of single, double, dashed, dotted, end,
            repeats, or none.

         -- 8th note and shorter notes can  have  either  flags  or
            beams; beams can be cross-staff.

         -- Guitar grids

         -- Lyrics  can  be placed above, below, or between staffs.
            Unlimited number of verses, with control  of  font  and
            size.

         -- Headers and footers.

         -- Staffs can be grouped with braces or brackets.

         -- Automatic  transposition  of  music and chord marks per
            staff.

         -- First and subsequent endings.

         -- Optional  rehearsal  marks  and/or  automatic   measure
            numbering.   Rehearsal  marks can be boxed, circled, or
            plain.

         -- Crescendo/decrescendo marks.

         -- Rolls, ornaments, fermatas, accents.

         -- Measure repeats.

         -- Ties, slurs, phrase marks, octave  marks,  piano  pedal
            marks,  etc.   Ties,  slurs,  and  phrase  marks can be
            solid, dotted, or dashed.

         -- Suport for figured bass, analysis, and chords.

         -- Optional MIDI file output.  (Very  useful  for  "proof-
            listening" to your songs to check for input mistakes!)

         -- PostScript   output  for  printing  on  any  PostScript
            compatible   output   device.    Can   be   used   with
            Ghostscript.

         -- All symbols in all standard PostScript fonts supported,
            in 1 to 100 point size.

         -- Input is a text  file,  for  easy  portability  between
            computer systems.

         -- Macros and 'include' files.

         -- General  'if'  clauses  that  can  be  used to generate
            different outputs based on values of parameters.

         -- Mup will determine how to lay out the music, but  there
            are  numerous  user controls available to fine-tune the
            output to meet your specific needs.

         -- Comprehensive User's Guide provided in both  PostScript
            and HTML formats, including many examples.

         -- Mup  is  available to try out for free.  If you like it
            and want to keep it, the registration fee is far  lower
            than the cost of most music publication software.
