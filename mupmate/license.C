At Arkkra Enterprises, we'd like all our customers to be delighted with our\n\
products. To ensure that Mup and any other products or services we provide\n\
are readily available at the lowest possible cost to you, we need to\n\
establish licensing terms.\n\
\n\
While there are other music publication programs on the market, we believe\n\
Mup has unique features that you may find very useful. Since different\n\
people may want different things in a music publication program, you do not\n\
have to pay for Mup until after you've had a chance to try it out and\n\
evaluate it for yourself. If you have problems with Mup, let us know and we\n\
will try to resolve them. If you have paid your registration fee and we\n\
cannot resolve problems to your satisfaction, we will gladly refund your\n\
money.\n\
